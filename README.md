# BinaryObjectOrientedKollector
Binary Object Oriented Kollector - BOOK! An open-source project designed to help organize their home libraries in a lightweight program that anyone can use.
This is intended to be my Rutgers Summer 2023 Python Methodologies Final Project for Professor Lars Sorensen.
Ideally this program will store the data in a CSV that is then read and updated to allow a user to manage their book collection.

The data type will be a tuple, since the book information should be immutable (ISBN, Title, Author, Date obtained, etc.) and be easily read when called upon.
A search function will need to be implemented


After the initial backend draft is accomplished, I wouldn't mind looking for an amateur frontend developer to devise a GUI or other UX intended for generic users.

Assignment TODOs:

ACCOMPLISHED. 1) Assign each book to an array
                    Need to print each array out into a table that can be iterated into the writerows command.
ACCOMPLISHED. 2) Populate to 10k arrays
ACCOMPLISHED USING FAKER. 3) export each array to a row in an excel doc, where the columns are the function names (Title, Author, etc.)


Eventual TODOs:
1) Add a prompt asking the user what they want
2) A way to close the program without having to close the IDE or other interactions (similar to a "press Q to quit" function"
